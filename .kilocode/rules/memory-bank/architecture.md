# System Architecture Overview

Two-tier architecture: Electron desktop client for test execution, serverless N8N backend for result processing.

Client Architecture (Electron Application)

Main Process Layer:
- Timing Engine: High-precision event capture using Node.js process.hrtime.bigint()
- Database Manager: SQLite operations for local test data persistence
- IPC Handler: Secure communication bridge between main and renderer processes
- Network Manager: HTTPS client for webhook communication with retry logic
- Auth Integration: SuperTokens SDK for user verification

Renderer Process Layer:
- React UI Components: Test screen, stimulus presentation, email capture form
- State Management: Zustand store for test session state
- Animation Controller: requestAnimationFrame synchronization for stimulus timing
- Input Handlers: Keyboard/mouse event capture with IPC forwarding

Preload Layer:
- Context Bridge: Exposes secure API from main process to renderer
- Type-safe IPC channels for timing events and data operations

Data Flow - Test Execution:
1. User initiates test -> Timing Engine initializes in main process
2. Renderer presents stimulus -> records intended timestamp
3. Main process captures actual render via vblank sync
4. User responds -> input event captured in renderer
5. Event forwarded to main process via IPC
6. Main process records response with process.hrtime.bigint()
7. All events stored in memory array with nanosecond timestamps
8. Test completion triggers metric calculation in main process

Data Flow - Result Submission:
1. Email captured in renderer, forwarded to main process
2. Main process calls SuperTokens API to check user existence
3. Raw test data + user context saved to local SQLite
4. HTTPS POST to N8N webhook with retry exponential backoff
5. On successful 200 response, local SQLite record deleted
6. On failure, data persists for retry on next app launch

Server Architecture (Serverless N8N)

N8N Workflow Nodes:
1. Webhook Trigger: Receives POST with raw test data and email
2. SuperTokens Query: HTTP request to check user existence
3. Conditional Branch: User exists vs new user path
4. FHIR Patient Lookup: Query existing patient resource if user exists
5. User Creation: SuperTokens account + FHIR patient resource if new
6. Metric Calculation: JavaScript function node computes F.O.C.U.S. variables
7. Normative Data Fetch: PostgreSQL query filtered by age/gender
8. Statistical Comparison: JavaScript function computes percentiles
9. FHIR Write: Create DiagnosticReport resource with observations
10. Magic Link Generation: JWT token with expiration
11. Email Dispatch: SendGrid/SMTP with result access link
12. Response: Return 200 OK to client

Supporting Infrastructure:
- PostgreSQL Database: Stores user accounts, normative samples, FHIR resources
- HAPI FHIR Server: Healthcare data repository following HL7 FHIR standard
- SuperTokens Instance: Authentication and session management
- Email Service: Transactional email delivery

Key Technical Decisions

Decision: Use Electron instead of web browser
Rationale: Browser timing APIs cannot achieve ±1ms precision required for clinical validity. Electron provides Node.js access to process.hrtime.bigint() with nanosecond resolution and direct OS event handling.

Decision: Client-side test execution
Rationale: Eliminates network latency as variable in timing measurements. Ensures test reliability even with poor internet connectivity. Reduces server load to near-zero during testing.

Decision: SQLite for local storage
Rationale: Embedded database requires no separate service. Synchronous API simplifies error handling. Supports encryption for HIPAA compliance. Automatically deleted after successful upload.

Decision: N8N serverless workflow
Rationale: Visual workflow builder reduces development complexity. No infrastructure to manage. Pay-per-execution cost model. Easy to modify processing logic without code deployment.

Decision: Separate builds per platform
Rationale: Electron cannot produce universal binary. Platform-specific builds enable native installers and code signing. Industry-standard approach with electron-builder.

Decision: IPC for timing events
Rationale: Renderer process timing is unreliable due to browser engine constraints. Main process has direct OS access. IPC latency (<1ms) acceptable when main process captures actual timestamps.

Design Patterns

Command Pattern: User actions in renderer dispatched as commands to main process
Observer Pattern: Timing engine emits events consumed by multiple listeners
Repository Pattern: Database manager abstracts SQLite operations
Strategy Pattern: Different retry strategies for network failures
Factory Pattern: Test session factory creates configured timing instances

Critical Implementation Paths

Path 1: Stimulus Presentation Accuracy
- Renderer requests stimulus display with intended timestamp
- requestAnimationFrame syncs to display vblank
- Main process records actual presentation time
- Delta between intended and actual logged for quality control

Path 2: Response Capture Precision
- OS-level input event captured
- Main process immediately calls process.hrtime.bigint()
- Timestamp stored before any processing
- Response matched to stimulus in post-processing

Path 3: Data Integrity During Upload
- Test data serialized to JSON
- Encrypted and written to SQLite
- HTTPS POST attempted with timeout
- On success: DELETE from SQLite
- On failure: Record remains for retry, user notified

Path 4: Offline Resilience
- Application detects network availability before upload
- Queues results locally if offline
- Background service retries on app launch
- User can manually trigger retry from UI

Component Relationships

Electron Main Process owns:
- TimingEngine (creates timing events)
- DatabaseManager (persists test data)
- NetworkManager (communicates with N8N)
- AuthService (integrates SuperTokens)

React Renderer depends on:
- Main Process via IPC (all timing operations)
- Zustand Store (UI state only)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)

N8N Workflow depends on:
- PostgreSQL (normative data, user storage)
- FHIR Server (patient resources, reports)
- SuperTokens API (user management)
- Email Service (magic link delivery)

Security Boundaries:
- Renderer cannot access filesystem directly
- Renderer cannot make network requests
- All privileged operations proxied through preload context bridge
- SQLite database encrypted at rest
- HTTPS enforced for all server communication
